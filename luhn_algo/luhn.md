In this first problem, you will implement the Luhn algorithm, a simple verification scheme used for instance for credit card numbers.

A possible interface could be something like verify(digits) where digits is a string of decimal digits, and verify just returns true or false. Once you have a working solution, tidy and/or refactor it until you're happy with it. I'll use this as an excuse to introduce some of the ideas and techniques we'll dive deeper into during this course.

As usual, feel free to scale the problem up or down as needed for your current skill level.
